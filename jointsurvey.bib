abstract = {Distance sampling is a widely used method for estimating wildlife pop- ulation abundance. The fact that conventional distance sampling methods are partly design-based constrains the spatial resolution at which animal density can be estimated using these methods. Estimates are usually obtained at sur- vey stratum level. For an endangered species such as the blue whale, it is de- sirable to estimate density and abundance at a finer spatial scale than stratum. Temporal variation in the spatial structure is also important. We formulate the process generating distance sampling data as a thinned spatial point process and propose model-based inference using a spatial log-Gaussian Cox process. The method adopts a flexible stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to model spatial structure in density that is not accounted for by explanatory variables, and integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for Bayesian inference. It allows simultaneous fitting of detection and density models and permits prediction of density at an arbitrarily fine scale. We esti- mate blue whale density in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean from thirteen shipboard surveys conducted over 22 years. We find that higher blue whale density is associated with colder sea surface temperatures in space, and al- though there is some positive association between density and mean annual temperature, our estimates are consitent with no trend in density across years. Our analysis also indicates that there is substantial spatially structured varia- tion in density that is not explained by available covariates.},

abstract = {Spatial processes are central to many ecological processes, but fitting models that incorporate spatial correlation to data from ecological surveys is computationally challenging. This is particularly true of point pattern data (in which the primary data are the locations at which target species are found), but also true of gridded data, and of georeferenced samples from continuous spatial fields. We describe here the R package inlabru that builds on the widely used RINLA package to provide easier access to Bayesian inference from spatial point process, spatial count, gridded, and georeferenced data, using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA, Rue et al., 2009). The package provides methods for fitting spatial density surfaces and estimating abundance, as well as for plotting and prediction. It accommodates data that are points, counts, georeferenced samples, or distance sampling data. This paper describes the main features of the package, illustrated by fitting models to the gorilla nest data contained in the package spatstat (Baddeley, {\&} Turner, 2005), a line transect survey dataset contained in the package dsm (Miller, Rexstad, Burt, Bravington, {\&} Hedley, 2018), and to a georeferenced sample from a simulated continuous spatial field.},

abstract = {Aim: Species distribution models (SDMs) are common tools in biogeography and conservation ecology. It has been repeatedly claimed that aggregated (stacked) SDMs (S-SDMs) will overestimate species richness. One recently suggested solution to this problem is to use macroecological models of species richness to constrain S-SDMs. Here, we examine current practice in the development of S-SDMs to identify methodological problems, provide tools to overcome these issues, and quantify the performance of correctly stacked S-SDMs alongside macroecological models. Locations: Barents Sea, Europe and Dutch Wadden Sea. Methods: We present formal mathematical arguments demonstrating how S-SDMs should and should not be stacked. We then compare the performance of macroecological models and correctly stacked S-SDMs on the same data to determine if the former can be used to constrain the latter. Next, we develop a maximum-likelihood approach to adjusting S-SDMs and discuss how it could potentially be used in combination with macroecological models. Finally, we use this tool to quantify how S-SDMs deviate from observed richness in four very different case studies. Results: We demonstrate that stacking methods based on thresholding site-level occurrence probabilities will almost always be biased, and that these biases will tend toward systematic overprediction of richness. Next, we show that correctly stacked S-SDMs perform very similarly to macroecological models in that they both have a tendency to overpredict richness in species-poor sites and underpredict it in species-rich sites. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the perception that S-SDMs consistently overpredict richness is driven largely by incorrect stacking methods. With these biases removed, S-SDMs perform similarly to macroecological models, suggesting that combining the two model classes will not offer much improvement. However, if situations where coupling S-SDMs and macroecological models would be beneficial are subsequently identified, the tools we develop would facilitate such a synthesis. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Predictive models of species distributions are typically developed with data collected along roads. Roadside sampling may provide a biased (nonrandom) sample; however, it is currently unknown whether roadside sampling limits the accuracy of predictions generated by species distribution models. We tested whether roadside sampling affects the accuracy of predictions generated by species distribution models by using a prospective sampling strategy designed specifically to address this issue. We built models from roadside data and validated model predictions at paired locations on unpaved roads and 200 m away from roads (off road), spatially and temporally independent from the data used for model building. We predicted species distributions of 15 bird species on the basis of point-count data from a landbird monitoring program in Montana and Idaho (U.S.A.). We used hierarchical occupancy models to account for imperfect detection. We expected predictions of species distributions derived from roadside-sampling data would be less accurate when validated with data from off-road sampling than when it was validated with data from roadside sampling and that model accuracy would be differentially affected by whether species were generalists, associated with edges, or associated with interior forest. Model performance measures (kappa, area under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic plot, and true skill statistic) did not differ between model predictions of roadside and off-road distributions of species. Furthermore, performance measures did not differ among edge, generalist, and interior species, despite a difference in vegetation structure along roadsides and off road and that 2 of the 15 species were more likely to occur along roadsides. If the range of environmental gradients is surveyed in roadside-sampling efforts, our results suggest that surveys along unpaved roads can be a valuable, unbiased source of information for species distribution models. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {The need to understand the impacts of land management for conservation, agriculture and disease prevention are driving demand for new predictive ecology approaches that can reliably forecast future changes in population size. Currently, although the link between habitat composition and animal population dynamics is undisputed, its function has not been quantified in a way that enables accurate prediction of population change in nature. Here, using 12 house sparrow colonies as a proof-of-concept, we apply recent theoretical advances to predict population growth or decline from detailed data on habitat composition and habitat selection. We show, for the first time, that statistical population models using derived covariates constructed from parametric descriptions of habitat composition and habitat selection can explain an impressive 92{\%} of observed population variation. More importantly, they provide excellent predictive power under cross-validation, anticipating 81{\%} of variability in population change. These models may be embedded in readily available generalized linear modelling frameworks, allowing their rapid application to field systems. Furthermore, we use optimization on our sample of sparrow colonies to demonstrate how such models, linking populations to their habitats, permit the design of practical and environmentally sound habitat manipulations for managing populations.},

abstract = {The increase in availability of species datasets means that approaches to species distribution modelling that incorporate multiple datasets are in greater demand. Recent methodological developments in this area have led to combined likelihood approaches, in which a log-likelihood comprised of the sum of the log-likelihood components of each data source is maximized. Often, these approaches make use of at least one presence-only dataset and use the log-likelihood of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process model in the combined likelihood construction. While these advancements have been shown to improve predictive performance, they do not currently address challenges in presence-only modelling such as checking and correcting for violations of the independence assumption of a Poisson point process model or more general challenges in species distribution modelling such as overfitting. In this paper, we present an extension of the combined likelihood framework which accommodates alternative presence-only likelihoods in the presence of spatial dependence as well as lasso-type penalties to account for potential overfitting. We compare the proposed combined penalized likelihood approach to the standard combined likelihood approach via simulation and apply the method to modelling the distribution of the Eurasian lynx in the Jura Mountains in eastern France. The simulations show that the proposed combined penalized likelihood approach has better predictive performance than the standard approach when spatial dependence is present in the data. The lynx analysis shows that the predicted maps vary significantly between the model fitted with the proposed combined penalized approach accounting for spatial dependence and the model fitted with the standard combined likelihood. This work highlights the benefits of careful consideration of the presence-only components of the combined likelihood formulation, and allows greater flexibility and ability to accommodate real datasets.},

abstract = {1. Aerial seabird surveys are often conducted so that changes in abundance may be monitored. For example, large-scale offshore wind farms are proposed for UK waters, and surveys are currently being conducted to quantify numbers and distribution ahead of construction. 2. Technological advances mean that strip transect surveys may now be conducted, using digital methods. We address survey design and data analysis issues for such digital surveys, contrasting them with visual aerial line transect surveys. 3. We also explore the relative performances of the methods for estimating the size of a large aggregation of common scoters in Carmarthen Bay, Wales. We found that abundance estimates from two digital methods were closely comparable, while estimates from visual aerial surveys were appreciably lower. 4. Synthesis and applications. Efficient survey methods to quantify abundance and distribution of seabirds are needed, to assess change arising from climate change, or developments such as the construction of large-scale offshore wind farms. The traditional survey methods are visual surveys conducted along transects from ships or aircraft. Digital video and stills surveys can be conducted from aircraft flying sufficiently high to avoid disturbance, while still being able to detect and identify seabirds. Given the rapid technological developments, we expect digital surveys largely to replace visual surveys for seabirds in offshore regions.

abstract = {The distribution, movements and abundance of highly mobile marine species such as bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus are best studied at large spatial scales, but previous research effort has generally been focused on relatively small areas, occupied by populations with high site fidelity. We aimed to characterize the distribution, movements and abundance of bottlenose dolphins around the coasts of Scotland, exploring how data from multiple sources could be integrated to build a broader-scale picture of their ecology. We reviewed existing historical data, integrated data from ongoing studies and developed new collaborative studies to describe distribution patterns. We adopted a Bayesian multi-site mark-recapture model to estimate abundance of bottlenose dolphins throughout Scottish coastal waters and quantified movements of individuals between study areas. The majority of sightings of bottlenose dolphins around the Scottish coastline are concentrated on the east and west coasts, but records are rare before the 1990s. Dedicated photo-identification studies in 2006 and 2007 were used to estimate the size of two resident populations: one on the east coast from the Moray Firth to Fife, population estimate 195 [95{\%} highest posterior density intervals (HPDI): 162-253] and the second in the Hebrides, population estimate 45 (95{\%} HPDI: 33-66). Interaction parameters demonstrated that the dolphins off the east coast of Scotland are highly mobile, whereas those off the west coast form two discrete communities. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of the abundance of bottlenose dolphins in the inshore waters of Scotland. The combination of dedicated photo-identification studies and opportunistic sightings suggest that a relatively small number of bottlenose dolphins (200-300 individuals) occur regularly in Scottish coastal waters. On both east and west coasts, re-sightings of identifiable individuals indicate that the animals have been using these coastal areas since studies began. {\textcopyright} 2012 Mammal Society/Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {In the case of marine systems, monitoring seabird populations at sea require adequate, low cost protocols that maximize data resolution, accuracy and survey effort. This paper examines bias associated with pelagic aerial strip-transects, an easily designed and low cost survey method, to validate its use for monitoring and mapping seabird populations at sea at a very large scale. We used data collected on the entire seabird community between October 2001 and March 2002 in the Bay of Biscay (100 000 km2 on the French Atlantic coast, Northeast Atlantic) to determine whether aerial strip-transect seabird survey were subject to temporal (i.e. variations of detection probability during the survey) or distance (i.e. variations of detection probability across the strip) bias. To detect these biases, two seabird taxa were contrasted, the highly conspicuous northern gannet versus three cryptic species of auks pooled as one taxonomic group. We reported that the only temporal bias was attributable to sun glare. By contrast, distance bias did not occur in a strip of 150 m for both species, and the effect of distance up to 230 m was very weak. We conclude that visibility bias have a limited effect on pelagic aerial surveys for most seabird species. Particular attention should be paid to the constant record of sun glare, while altitude and speed can be fixed in a relatively wide range (140-180 m, 150-200 km/h) without affecting detection probability. Since distance bias did not occur across a 150 m strip, there is no need to add complexity to survey protocol by using line-transect method. This method takes distance effects into account but requires distance estimates between the bird and the transect line for every sightings. These estimates are usually easily collected in the case of marine mammals but become problematic in the case of flying animals such seabirds, sometimes encountered in very high density and aggregated into groups of several hundred individuals. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Aim During the past decade ecologists have attempted to estimate the parameters of species distribution models by combining locations of species presence observed in opportunistic surveys with spatially referenced covariates of occurrence. Several statistical models have been proposed for the analysis of presence-only data, but these models have largely ignored the effects of imperfect detection and survey bias. In this paper I describe a model-based approach for the analysis of presence-only data that accounts for errors in the detection of individuals and for biased selection of survey locations. Innovation I develop a hierarchical, statistical model that allows presence-only data to be analysed in conjunction with data acquired independently in planned surveys. One component of the model specifies the spatial distribution of individuals within a bounded, geographic region as a realization of a spatial point process. A second component of the model specifies two kinds of observations, the detection of individuals encountered during opportunistic surveys and the detection of individuals encountered during planned surveys. Main conclusions Using mathematical proof and simulation-based comparisons, I demonstrate that biases induced by errors in detection or biased selection of survey locations can be reduced or eliminated by using the hierarchical model to analyse presence-only data in conjunction with counts observed in planned surveys. I show that a relatively small number of high-quality data (from planned surveys) can be used to leverage the information in presence-only observations, which usually have broad spatial coverage but may not be informative of both occurrence and detectability of individuals. Because a variety of sampling protocols can be used in planned surveys, this approach to the analysis of presence-only data is widely applicable. In addition, since the point-process model is formulated at the level of an individual, it can be extended to account for biological interactions between individuals and temporal changes in their spatial distributions.},

abstract = {Reliable methods to downscale species distributions from coarse to fine grain (equivalent to resolution or support) hold great potential benefit for ecology and conservation. Existing methods have been based on partially unrealistic assumptions and yield mixed results. Here, we introduce a novel and simple approach for downscaling species distribution models based on a hierarchical Bayesian modelling (HBM) framework. Our approach treats putative (unknown) fine-grain presences/absences as latent variables, which are modelled as a function of observed fine-grain environmental variables and constrained by observed coarse-grain presences/absences using logistic regression. The aim is to produce downscaled fine-grain probabilities of species occurrence that (1) closely resemble the probabilities produced by a logistic model parameterized with the observed fine-grain data (the 'reference model') and (2) are improvements over conventional downscaling methods. We additionally test how fine-grain occupancy based on power-law scale-area relationships modifies the downscaling results. We test our approach on 127 bird species from the San Diego breeding atlas data surveyed at 5 km grain. The HBM approach provides unbiased fine-grain probabilities of occurrence whilst the conventional methods (direct approach, point sampling) consistently over-predict occurrence probabilities. Incorporation of the downscaled occupancy further improves reliability of the models, but only in cases when the fine-grain occupancy is estimated accurately. Summing predictions across grid cells and species, HBMs provide better estimates of fine-grain species richness than conventional methods. They also provide better estimates of fine-grain occupancy (prevalence). The presented HBM-based downscaling approach offers improved predictions of fine-grain presence and absence compared with existing methods. The combination of the Bayesian approach with key macroecological relationships (specifically, the scale-area relationship) offers a promising general basis for downscaling distributions that may be extended, for example, using generalized linear or additive models. These approaches enable integrative predictions of spatial biodiversity patterns at fine grains. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Many of the most interesting questions ecologists ask lead to analyses of spatial data. Yet, perhaps confused by the large number of statistical models and fitting methods available, many ecologists seem to believe this is best left to specialists. Here, we describe the issues that need consideration when analysing spatial data and illustrate these using simulation studies. Our comparative analysis involves using methods including generalized least squares, spatial filters, wavelet revised models, conditional autoregressive models and generalized additive mixed models to estimate regression coefficients from synthetic but realistic data sets, including some which violate standard regression assumptions. We assess the performance of each method using two measures and using statistical error rates for model selection. Methods that performed well included generalized least squares family of models and a Bayesian implementation of the conditional auto-regressive model. Ordinary least squares also performed adequately in the absence of model selection, but had poorly controlled Type I error rates and so did not show the improvements in performance under model selection when using the above methods. Removing large-scale spatial trends in the response led to poor performance. These are empirical results; hence extrapolation of these findings to other situations should be performed cautiously. Nevertheless, our simulation-based approach provides much stronger evidence for comparative analysis than assessments based on single or small numbers of data sets, and should be considered a necessary foundation for statements of this type in future. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {In occupancy studies, species misidentification can lead to false-positive detections, which can cause severe estimator biases. Currently, all models that account for false-positive errors only consider omnibus sources of false detections and are limited to single-species occupancy. However, false detections for a given species often occur because of the misidentification with another, closely related species. To exploit this explicit source of false-positive detection error, we develop a two-species occupancy model that accounts for misidentifications between two species of interest. As with other false-positive models, identifiability is greatly improved by the availability of unambiguous detections at a subset of site x occasions. Here, we consider the case where some of the field observations can be confirmed using laboratory or other independent identification methods (“confirmatory data”). We performed three simulation studies to (1) assess the model's performance under various realistic scenarios, (2) investigate the influence of the proportion of confirmatory data on estimator accuracy and (3) compare the performance of this two-species model with that of the single-species false-positive model. The model shows good performance under all scenarios, even when only small proportions of detections are confirmed (e.g. 5{\%}). It also clearly outperforms the single-species model. We illustrate application of this model using a 4-year dataset on two sympatric species of lungless salamanders: the US federally endangered Shenandoah salamander Plethodon shenandoah, and its presumed competitor, the red-backed salamander Plethodon cinereus. Occupancy of red-backed salamanders appeared very stable across the 4 years of study, whereas the Shenandoah salamander displayed substantial turnover in occupancy of forest habitats among years. Given the extent of species misidentification issues in occupancy studies, this modelling approach should help improve the reliability of estimates of species distribution, which is the goal of many studies and monitoring programmes. Further developments, to account for different forms of state uncertainty, can be readily undertaken under our general approach.},

abstract = {Statistical modeling of presence-only data has attracted much recent attention in the ecological literature, leading to a proliferation of methods, including the inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP) model, maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling of species distributions and logistic regression models. Several recent articles have shown the close relationships between these methods. We explain why the IPP intensity function is a more natural object of inference in presence-only studies than occurrence probability (which is only defined with reference to quadrat size), and why presence-only data only allows estimation of relative, and not absolute intensity of species occurrence. All three of the above techniques amount to parametric density estimation under the same exponential family model (in the case of the IPP, the fitted density is multiplied by the number of presence records to obtain a fitted intensity). We show that IPP and Maxent give the exact same estimate for this density, but logistic regression in general yields a different estimate in finite samples. When the model is misspecified-as it practically always is- logistic regression and the IPP may have substantially different asymptotic limits with large data sets. We propose "infinitely weighted logistic regression," which is exactly equivalent to the IPP in finite samples. Consequently, many already-implemented methods extending logistic regression can also extend theMaxent and IPP models in directly analogous ways using this technique. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2013.},

abstract = {Aim: Using survey data for North American birds, we assess how well historical patterns of species richness are explained by stacked species distribution models and macroecological models. We then describe the degree to which projections of future species richness differ, employing both modelling approaches across multiple emissions scenarios. Location: USA and Canada. Methods: We use Audubon Christmas Bird Count and North American Breeding Bird Survey data to estimate current and future species richness of birds using two distinct approaches. In the first, we model richness by stacking predictions from individual species distribution models. In the second, we model richness directly, ignoring the contributions of specific taxa to richness estimates. Results: The two modelling approaches show similar accuracies when validated with historical observations, particularly winter observations, and result in similar patterns of richness when projected onto current and future climate spaces. Patterns of projected change in species richness differed markedly between winter and summer seasons regardless of modelling approach. Our models suggest that bird species richness in winter will increase or remain stable across much of North America. In contrast, species richness in summer is projected to decrease over much of North America, except part of northern Canada, suggesting that climate may constrain many breeding bird species and communities in the future. Main conclusions: Stacked species distribution models and macroecological models produce similar estimates of current and future species richness for each of two seasons despite being built on different concepts of community assembly. Our results suggest that, although the mechanisms that shape geographical variation in biodiversity remain uncertain, these limitations do not impede our ability to predict patterns of species richness at broad scales. Congruence of species richness projections across modelling approaches is encouraging for conservation planning efforts that focus on retaining biodiversity into the future.},

@article{Matthiopoulos2015Fitness,
abstract = {Although classical ecological theory (e.g., on ideal free consumers) recognizes the potential effect of population density on the spatial distribution of animals, empirical species distribution models assume that species–habitat relationships remain unchanged across a range of population sizes. Conversely, even though ecological models and experiments have demonstrated the importance of spatial heterogeneity for the rate of population change, we still have no practical method for making the connection between the makeup of real environments, the expected distribution and fitness of their occupants, and the long-term implications of fitness for population growth. Here, we synthesize several conceptual advances into a mathematical framework using a measure of fitness to link habitat availability/selection to (density-dependent) population growth in mobile animal species. A key feature of this approach is that it distinguishes between apparent habitat suitability and the true, underlying contribution of a habitat to fitness, allowing the statistical coefficients of both to be estimated from multiple observation instances of the species in different environments and stages of numerical growth. Hence, it leverages data from both historical population time series and snapshots of species distribution to predict population performance under environmental change. We propose this framework as a foundation for building more realistic connections between a population's use of space and its subsequent dynamics (and hence a contribution to the ongoing efforts to estimate a species' critical habitat and fundamental niche). We therefore detail its associated definitions and simplifying assumptions, because they point to the framework's future extensions. We show how the model can be fit to data on species distributions and population dynamics, using standard statistical methods, and we illustrate its application with an individual-based simulation. When contrasted with nonspatial population models, our approach is better at fitting and predicting population growth rates and carrying capacities. Our approach can be generalized to include a diverse range of biological considerations. We discuss these possible extensions and applications to real data.},

abstract = {With the internet, a massive amount of information on species abundance can be collected by citizen science programs. However, these data are often difficult to use directly in statistical inference, as their collection is generally opportunistic, and the distribution of the sampling effort is often not known. In this article, we develop a general statistical framework to combine such "opportunistic data" with data collected using schemes characterized by a known sampling effort. Under some structural assumptions regarding the sampling effort and detectability, our approach makes it possible to estimate the relative abundance of several species in different sites. It can be implemented through a simple generalized linear model. We illustrate the framework with typical bird datasets from the Aquitaine region in south-western France. We show that, under some assumptions, our approach provides estimates that are more precise than the ones obtained from the dataset with a known sampling effort alone. When the opportunistic data are abundant, the gain in precision may be considerable, especially for rare species. We also show that estimates can be obtained even for species recorded only in the opportunistic scheme. Opportunistic data combined with a relatively small amount of data collected with a known effort may thus provide access to accurate and precise estimates of quantitative changes in relative abundance over space and/or time.},

abstract = {Aim: Accurate predictions of cetacean distributions are essential to their conservation but are limited by statistical challenges and a paucity of data. This study aimed at comparing the capacity of various statistical algorithms to deal with biases commonly found in nonsystematic cetacean surveys and to evaluate the potential for citizen science data to improve habitat modelling and predictions. An endangered population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in their breeding ground was used as a case study. Location: New Caledonia, Oceania. Methods: Five statistical algorithms were used to model the habitat preferences of humpback whales from 1,360 sightings collected over 14 years of nonsystematic research surveys. Three different background sampling approaches were tested when developing models from 625 crowdsourced sightings to assess methods accounting for citizen science spatial sampling bias. Model evaluation was conducted through cross-validation and prediction to an independent satellite tracking dataset. Results: Algorithms differed in complexity of the environmental relationships modelled, ecological interpretability and transferability. While parameter tuning had a great effect on model performances, GLMs generally had low predictive performance, SVMs were particularly hard to interpret, and BRTs had high descriptive power but showed signs of overfitting. MAXENT and especially GAMs provided a valuable complexity trade-off, accurate predictions and were ecologically intelligible. Models showed that humpback whales favoured cool (22–23°C) and shallow waters (0–100 m deep) in coastal as well as offshore areas. Citizen science models converged with research survey models, specifically when accounting for spatial sampling bias. Main conclusions: Marine megafauna distribution models present specific challenges that may be addressed through integrative evaluation, independent testing and appropriately tuned statistical algorithms. Specifically, controlling overfitting is a priority when predicting cetacean distributions for large-scale conservation perspectives. Citizen science data appear to be a powerful tool to describe cetacean habitat.},

abstract = {1.Understanding the factors affecting species occurrence is a pre-eminent focus of applied ecological research. However, direct information about species occurrence is lacking for many species. Instead, researchers sometimes have to rely on so-called presence-only data (i.e. when no direct information about absences is available), which often results from opportunistic, unstructured sampling. maxent is a widely used software program designed to model and map species distribution using presence-only data. 2.We provide a critical review of maxent as applied to species distribution modelling and discuss how it can lead to inferential errors. A chief concern is that maxent produces a number of poorly defined indices that are not directly related to the actual parameter of interest – the probability of occurrence ({\$}\psi{\$}). This focus on an index was motivated by the belief that it is not possible to estimate {\$}\psi{\$} from presence-only data; however, we demonstrate that {\$}\psi{\$} is identifiable using conventional likelihood methods under the assumptions of random sampling and constant probability of species detection. 3.The model is implemented in a convenient r package which we use to apply the model to simulated data and data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We demonstrate that maxent produces extreme under-predictions when compared to estimates produced by logistic regression which uses the full (presence/absence) data set. We note that maxent predictions are extremely sensitive to specification of the background prevalence, which is not objectively estimated using the maxent method. 4.As with maxent, formal model-based inference requires a random sample of presence locations. Many presence-only data sets, such as those based on museum records and herbarium collections, may not satisfy this assumption. However, when sampling is random, we believe that inference should be based on formal methods that facilitate inference about interpretable ecological quantities instead of vaguely defined indices.},

abstract = {Executive summary {\textperiodcentered} The coastal and offshore waters of the UK are of global importance for several species of seabirds. The United Nations Law of the Seas and the establishment of Exclusive Economic Zones gives coastal states extensive rights but also obligations over marine areas, including the assessment of potential effects of activities on the marine environment. The Crown Estate, as landowner of the seabed out to the 12 nautical mile territorial limit plays an important role in the development of the offshore wind industry by leasing areas of seabed for the placing of turbines. The planned erection of large numbers of offshore wind turbines has underlined our lack of knowledge relating to the distribution, abundance and habitat requirements (foraging ecology) of marine birds. {\textperiodcentered} As part of the Environmental Impact Assessments for offshore wind farms, the need for detailed knowledge on spatial and temporal patterns in seabird distribution has been identified. Dedicated censuses to sample the numbers and distribution of seabirds are a basic requirement for developers, to describe bird densities within, and in the immediate vicinity of, the construction area. Studies performed need to be related to some greater area studies, in order to assess the relative and the actual importance of the construction area for the species involved. {\textperiodcentered} This document evaluates existing census techniques and determine the best currently available methods for defining bird distribution and abundance at sea. The underlying question is twofold: (1) what are the research objectives and what data are required for EIAs for offshore wind farms, and (2) how good are existing census techniques at fulfilling the objectives? {\textperiodcentered} In order to assess the potential impact of the construction of an offshore wind farm and to understand how such a construction is likely to affect the birds associated with a site, dedicated research is required. The coupling of bird census data with geographical, hydrographical, and biological measurements is essential to begin to understand how an offshore construction such as a wind farm is likely to affect an area and how the seabirds associated with a site are most likely to respond. Natural variability issues are addressed and existing census techniques have been evaluated for their potential to provide data that can be used to describe habitat characteristics and area usage by seabirds. {\textperiodcentered} The two observation tools discussed in this study, aerial and ship-based surveys, potentially provide similar data for as far as basic seabird counts are concerned (accurate numbers, accurate maps). Census techniques are similar (distance techniques using parallel bands of known width), but the level of detail for individual species is considerably less during aerial surveys. Aerial surveys are quick, so enabling coverage of larger areas per unit time, and relatively cheap, whereas ship-surveys are more timeconsuming. {\textperiodcentered} Data obtained during aerial surveys may be combined with environmental parameters in a correlative approach, whereas the advantage of a ship is that such parameters can often be collected simultaneously. The slower approach with vessels allows detailed observations on seabird behaviour (habitat utilisation, feeding conditions) and diurnal/tidal fluctuations in seabird abundance and distribution. {\textperiodcentered} The acquisition of information about migration routes, direction or height of flight, detailed spatial and temporal distribution require intensive radar and direct observation in the vicinity of a proposed wind farm development to determine bird use of the area and to predict collision impact probabilities under a range of differing temporal (day/night) and weather conditions. Similarly, assessment of actual collision risk and collisions after construction necessitates static measuring devices (such as infra-red movement triggered video surveillance and vibration detection equipment currently under development). However, these tools are not addressed further in this report.},

abstract = {Aim: Modelling species distributions at the community level is required to make effective forecasts of global change impacts on diversity and ecosystem functioning. Community predictions may be achieved using macroecological properties of communities (macroecological models, MEM), or by stacking of individual species distribution models (stacked species distribution models, S-SDMs). To obtain more realistic predictions of species assemblages, the SESAM (spatially explicit species assemblage modelling) framework suggests applying successive filters to the initial species source pool, by combining different modelling approaches and rules. Here we provide a first test of this framework in mountain grassland communities. Location: The western Swiss Alps. Methods: Two implementations of the SESAM framework were tested: a 'probability ranking' rule based on species richness predictions and rough probabilities from SDMs, and a 'trait range' rule that uses the predicted upper and lower bound of community-level distribution of three different functional traits (vegetative height, specific leaf area, and seed mass) to constrain a pool of species from binary SDMs predictions. Results: We showed that all independent constraints contributed to reduce species richness overprediction. Only the 'probability ranking' rule allowed slight but significant improvements in the predictions of community composition. Main conclusions: We tested various implementations of the SESAM framework by integrating macroecological constraints into S-SDM predictions, and report one that is able to improve compositional predictions. We discuss possible improvements, such as further understanding the causality and precision of environmental predictors, using other assembly rules and testing other types of ecological or functional constraints.},

abstract = {While the mechanistic links between animal movement and population dynamics are ecologically obvious, it is much less clear when knowledge of animal movement is a prerequisite for understanding and predicting population dynamics. GPS and other technologies enable detailed tracking of animal location concurrently with acquisition of landscape data and information on individual physiology. These tools can be used to refine our understanding of the mechanistic links between behaviour and individual condition through 'spatially informed' movement models where time allocation to different behaviours affects individual survival and reproduction. For some species, socially informed models that address the movements and average fitness of differently sized groups and how they are affected by fission-fusion processes at relevant temporal scales are required. Furthermore, as most animals revisit some places and avoid others based on their previous experiences, we foresee the incorporation of long-term memory and intention in movement models. The way animals move has important consequences for the degree of mixing that we expect to find both within a population and between individuals of different species. The mixing rate dictates the level of detail required by models to capture the influence of heterogeneity and the dynamics of intra- and interspecific interaction.},

abstract = {Two main sources of data for species distribution models (SDMs) are site-occupancy (SO) data from planned surveys, and presence-background (PB) data from opportunistic surveys and other sources. SO surveys give high quality data about presences and absences of the species in a particular area. However, due to their high cost, they often cover a smaller area relative to PB data, and are usually not representative of the geographic range of a species. In contrast, PB data is plentiful, covers a larger area, but is less reliable due to the lack of information on species absences, and is usually characterised by biased sampling. Here we present a new approach for species distribution modelling that integrates these two data types. We have used an inhomogeneous Poisson point process as the basis for constructing an integrated SDM that fits both PB and SO data simultaneously. It is the first implementation of an Integrated SO–PB Model which uses repeated survey occupancy data and also incorporates detection probability. The Integrated Model's performance was evaluated, using simulated data and compared to approaches using PB or SO data alone. It was found to be superior, improving the predictions of species spatial distributions, even when SO data is sparse and collected in a limited area. The Integrated Model was also found effective when environmental covariates were significantly correlated. Our method was demonstrated with real SO and PB data for the Yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus australis) in south-eastern Australia, with the predictive performance of the Integrated Model again found to be superior. PB models are known to produce biased estimates of species occupancy or abundance. The small sample size of SO datasets often results in poor out-of-sample predictions. Integrated models combine data from these two sources, providing superior predictions of species abundance compared to using either data source alone. Unlike conventional SDMs which have restrictive scale-dependence in their predictions, our Integrated Model is based on a point process model and has no such scale-dependency. It may be used for predictions of abundance at any spatial-scale while still maintaining the underlying relationship between abundance and area.},

The reliability of alternative surveys conducted at sea has not previously been validated. Sample-based estimates from at-sea surveys could be biased and have poor precision due to non-random survey design and the uneven distribution of seabirds at sea. 2. We conducted at-sea surveys of western gulls Larus occidentalis and common guillemots Uria aalge of the Farallon Islands, California, USA, and waved albatrosses Phoebastria irrorata of the Gal{\'{a}}pagos. The observed counts were modelled using generalized additive models (GAMs), with a correction factor for bird movement relative to the ship included in an offset. The models were used to produce estimates of the size of the seabird populations at sea, which were compared with independent colony-based estimates, adjusted to account for the number of non-breeders. 3. Gull and guillemot populations were estimated separately for each of 10 survey years. Temporal trends were estimated by smoothing through the annual values. The albatross data from 7 survey years were pooled to obtain a single estimate of average population size. 4. The coefficients of variation (CVs) of the annual estimates were approximately 10{\%}, 15-20{\%} and 15-45{\%} prior to smoothing for the albatross, gull and guillemot, respectively. The CVs of the smoothed estimates were about 10{\%} for the gull and 15{\%} for the guillemot. These represent substantial improvements in precision over previous sample-based estimates from at-sea surveys. 5. The colony-based estimates usually lay within the 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) of both the annual and smoothed sea-based estimates, showing that the sea-based methods worked well. 6. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that GAMs of at-sea seabird survey data, collected under suitable protocols and corrected for bird movement, can accurately estimate population size. Given sufficient demographic information, these methods can provide a valuable tool for the management of populations that are difficult to census at the breeding colony.},

@article{Matthiopoulos2015Fitness,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 by the Ecological Society of America. Although classical ecological theory (e.g., on ideal free consumers) recognizes the potential effect of population density on the spatial distribution of animals, empirical species distribution models assume that species-habitat relationships remain unchanged across a range of population sizes. Conversely, even though ecologicalmodels and experiments have demonstrated the importance of spatial heterogeneity for the rate of population change, we still have no practical method for making the connection between the makeup of real environments, the expected distribution and fitness of their occupants, and the long-termimplications of fitness for population growth. Here, we synthesize several conceptual advances into a mathematical framework using a measure of fitness to link habitat availability/selection to (density-dependent) population growth in mobile animal species. A key feature of this approach is that it distinguishes between apparent habitat suitability and the true, underlying contribution of a habitat to fitness, allowing the statistical coefficients of both to be estimated frommultiple observation instances of the species in different environments and stages of numerical growth. Hence, it leverages data from both historical population time series and snapshots of species distribution to predict population performance under environmental change. We propose this framework as a foundation for building more realistic connections between a population's use of space and its subsequent dynamics (and hence a contribution to the ongoing efforts to estimate a species' critical habitat and fundamental niche). We therefore detail its associated definitions and simplifying assumptions, because they point to the framework's future extensions. We show how the model can be fit to data on species distributions and population dynamics, using standard statistical methods, and we illustrate its application with an individual-based simulation. When contrasted with nonspatial population models, our approach is better at fitting and predicting population growth rates and carrying capacities. Our approach can be generalized to include a diverse range of biological considerations. We discuss these possible extensions and applications to real data.},

abstract = {The distributions of animal populations change and evolve through time. Migratory species exploit different habitats at different times of the year. Biotic and abiotic features that determine where a species lives vary due to natural and anthropogenic factors. This spatiotemporal variation needs to be accounted for in any modeling of species' distributions. In this paper we introduce a semiparametric model that provides a flexible framework for analyzing dynamic patterns of species occurrence and abundance from broad-scale survey data. The spatiotemporal exploratory model (STEM) adds essential spatiotemporal structure to existing techniques for developing species distribution models through a simple parametric structure without requiring a detailed understanding of the underlying dynamic processes. STEMs use a multi-scale strategy to differentiate between local and global-scale spatiotemporal structure. A user-specified species distribution model accounts for spatial and temporal patterning at the local level. These local patterns are then allowed to "scale up" via ensemble averaging to larger scales. This makes STEMs especially well suited for exploring distributional dynamics arising from a variety of processes. Using data from eBird, an online citizen science bird-monitoring project, we demonstrate that monthly changes in distribution of a migratory species, the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), can be more accurately described with a STEM than a conventional bagged decision tree model in which spatiotemporal structure has not been imposed. We also demonstrate that there is no loss of model predictive power when a STEM is used to describe a spatiotemporal distribution with very little spatiotemporal variation; the distribution of a nonmigratory species, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis).},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to inform a range of ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications. However, users often underestimate the strong links between data type, model output and suitability for end-use. We synthesize current knowledge and provide a simple framework that summarizes how interactions between data type and the sampling process (i.e. imperfect detection and sampling bias) determine the quantity that is estimated by a SDM. We then draw upon the published literature and simulations to illustrate and evaluate the information needs of the most common ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications of SDM outputs. We find that, while predictions of models fitted to the most commonly available observational data (presence records) suffice for some applications, others require estimates of occurrence probabilities, which are unattainable without reliable absence records. Our literature review and simulations reveal that, while converting continuous SDM outputs into categories of assumed presence or absence is common practice, it is seldom clearly justified by the application's objective and it usually degrades inference. Matching SDMs to the needs of particular applications is critical to avoid poor scientific inference and management outcomes. This paper aims to help modellers and users assess whether their intended SDM outputs are indeed fit for purpose.},

To infer spatial and temporal patterns, species distribution models have been developed for use with many sampling designs and types of data. Recently, it has been shown that count, presence-absence, and presence-only data can be conceptualized as arising from a point process distribution. Therefore, it is important to understand properties of the point process distribution. We examine how the hierarchical species distribution modeling framework has been used to incorporate a wide array of regression and theory-based components while accounting for the data collection process and making use of auxiliary information. The hierarchical modeling framework allows us to demonstrate how several commonly used species distribution models can be derived from the point process distribution, highlight areas of potential overlap between different models, and suggest areas where further research is needed.},

Presence-absence or count data collected in systematic, planned surveys are more reliable but typically less abundant. We proposed a probabilistic model to allow for joint analysis of presence-only and survey data to exploit their complementary strengths. Our method pools presence-only and presence-absence data for many species and maximizes a joint likelihood, simultaneously estimating and adjusting for the sampling bias affecting the presence-only data. By assuming that the sampling bias is the same for all species, we can borrow strength across species to efficiently estimate the bias and improve our inference from presence-only data. We evaluate our model's performance on data for 36 eucalypt species in south-eastern Australia. We find that presence-only records exhibit a strong sampling bias towards the coast and towards Sydney, the largest city. Our data-pooling technique substantially improves the out-of-sample predictive performance of our model when the amount of available presence-absence data for a given species is scarce If we have only presence-only data and no presence-absence data for a given species, but both types of data for several other species that suffer from the same spatial sampling bias, then our method can obtain an unbiased estimate of the first species' geographic range.},

@article{Lahoz-Monfort2014,
abstract = {Aim: Species often remain undetected at sites where they are present. However, the impact of imperfect detection on species distribution models (SDMs) is not fully appreciated. In this paper we evaluate the influence of imperfect detection on the calibration and discrimination capacity of SDMs. We compare the performance of three types of SDMs: (1) a technique based on presence-absence data, (2) a technique based on presence-background data, and (3) a technique based on detection/non-detection data that accounts for imperfect detection. Innovation: We use simulations to evaluate the impacts of imperfect detection in SDMs. This allows us to assess model performance with respect to the true objective of the models: the estimation of species distributions. We study a range of scenarios of occupancy and detection based on ecologically plausible environmental relationships and identify the circumstances in which imperfect detection affects model calibration and discrimination. We show that imperfect detection can substantially reduce the inferential and predictive accuracy of presence-absence and presence-background methods that do not account for detectability. While calibration is always affected, the influence on discrimination depends on the relationship of detectability and environmental variables. Main conclusions: The performance of a model should be assessed with respect to its objectives. Comparative studies that intend to assess the performance of an SDM by evaluating its ability to predict detections rather than presences fail to reveal the benefits of accounting for detectability. Disregarding imperfect detection can have severe consequences for SDM performance, and hence for the estimation of species distributions. To date, this issue has been largely ignored in the SDM literature. Simultaneously modelling occupancy and detection does not necessarily require a greater sampling effort, but rather that data are collected so that they are informative about detectability. We recommend that consideration of imperfect detection become standard practice for species distribution modelling. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Assessing the impacts of ongoing climate and anthropogenic-induced change on wildlife populations requires understanding species distributions and abundances across large spatial and temporal scales. For threatened or declining populations, collecting sufficient broad-scale data is challenging as sample sizes tend to be low because many such species are rare and/or elusive. As a result, demographic data are often piecemeal, leading to difficulties in determining causes of population changes and developing strategies to mitigate the effects of environmental stressors. Thus, the population dynamics of threatened species across spatio-temporal extents is typically inferred through incomplete, independent, local-scale studies. Emerging integrative modeling approaches, such as integrated population models (IPMs), combine multiple data types into a single analysis and provide a foundation for overcoming problems of sparse or fragmentary data. In this paper, we demonstrate how IPMs can be successfully implemented by synthesizing the elements, advantages, and novel insights of this modeling approach. We highlight the latest developments in IPMs that are explicitly relevant to the ecology and conservation of threatened species, including capabilities to quantify the spatial scale of management, source-sink dynamics, synchrony within metapopulations, and population density effects on demographic rates. Adoption of IPMs has led to improved detection of population declines, adaptation of targeted monitoring schemes, and refined management strategies. Continued methodological advancements of IPMs, such as incorporation of a wider set of data types (e.g., citizen science data) and coupled population-environment models, will allow for broader applicability within ecological and conservation sciences.},

abstract = {Aim: Current interest in forecasting changes to species ranges has resulted in a multitude of approaches to species distribution models (SDMs). However, most approaches include only a small subset of the available information, and many ignore smaller-scale processes such as growth, fecundity and dispersal. Furthermore, different approaches often produce divergent predictions with no simple method to reconcile them. Here, we present a flexible framework for integrating models at multiple scales using hierarchical Bayesian methods. Location: Eastern North America (as an example). Methods: Our framework builds a metamodel that is constrained by the results of multiple sub-models and provides probabilistic estimates of species presence. We applied our approach to a simulated dataset to demonstrate the integration of a correlative SDM with a theoretical model. In a second example, we built an integrated model combining the results of a physiological model with presence-absence data for sugar maple (Acer saccharum), an abundant tree native to eastern North America. Results: For both examples, the integrated models successfully included information from all data sources and substantially improved the characterization of uncertainty. For the second example, the integrated model outperformed the source models with respect to uncertainty when modelling the present range of the species. When projecting into the future, the model provided a consensus view of two models that differed substantially in their predictions. Uncertainty was reduced where the models agreed and was greater where they diverged, providing a more realistic view of the state of knowledge than either source model. Main conclusions: We conclude by discussing the potential applications of our method and its accessibility to applied ecologists. In ideal cases, our framework can be easily implemented using off-the-shelf software. The framework has wide potential for use in species distribution modelling and can drive better integration of multi-source and multi-scale data into ecological decision-making.},

abstract = {An understanding of the distribution and habitat associations of far-ranging marine predators is being increasingly applied to protect these species from anthropogenic threats at sea (e.g. oil spills and fisheries bycatch). Within this framework, this research on Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea integrates vessel-based survey and tracking data to provide 2 distinct, yet complementary, perspectives of the habitats of this species in the western Mediterranean during incubation in June and chick rearing in August of 2007. We used a hierarchical modelling approach to (1) delineate the foraging habitat of the species using vessel-based surveys and (2) identify its feeding habitat based on tracking data within the Information-Theoretic framework. Our habitat modelling analyses suggest that shearwaters respond to complex bio-physical coupling, illustrated by their association with frontal features and elevated ocean productivity. Our models yielded moderate predictions of Cory's shearwater habitats within 2 distinct spatial scales. At the mesoscale, the foraging range of the species comprised the continental and insular shelf-slope waters of the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, between the Gulf of Lions to the north and Cape Palos to the south. At the coarse scale, the tracking data highlighted important feeding areas within this larger foraging range: 3 continental shelf-slope 'hotspots' - (1) Gulf of Lions, (2) Cape Creus-Barcelona-Ebro Delta and (3) Cape La Nao-Cape Palos; from north to south - as well as the insular shelf-slope areas around the Balearic Islands. These results match previous observations of the foraging range and feeding patterns of the species, and are consistent with the interpretation of the regional oceanography. This study highlights how the integration of tracking and vessel-based survey data can provide a wider understanding of the predictability of aggregation (i.e. hotspots) and the key oceanographic habitats of far-ranging seabirds at multiple spatial scales. Thus, complementary data integration is a step forward in conservation studies of far-ranging marine top predators.},

In particular, we consider spatial modelling techniques that may be advantageous to applied ecologists such as quantification of uncertainty in a two-stage model and smoothing in areas with complex boundaries. The methods discussed are available in an R package developed by the authors (dsm) and are largely implemented in the popular Windows software Distance. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Mapping the distribution of seabirds at sea is fundamental to understanding their ecology and making informed decisions on their conservation. Until recently, estimates of at-sea distributions were generally derived from boat-based visual surveys. Increasingly however, seabird tracking is seen as an alternative but each has potential biases. To compare distributions from the two methods, we carried out simultaneous boat-based surveys and GPS tracking in the Minch, western Scotland, in June 2015. Over 8 days, boat transect surveys covered 950 km, within a study area of ∼6,700 km2 centered on the Shiant Islands, one of the main breeding centers of razorbills, and guillemots in the UK. Simultaneously, we GPS-tracked chick-rearing guillemots (n = 17) and razorbills (n = 31) from the Shiants. We modeled counts per unit area from boat surveys as smooth functions of latitude and longitude, mapping estimated densities. We then used kernel density estimation to map the utilization distributions of the GPS tracked birds. These two distribution estimates corresponded well for razorbills but were lower for guillemots. Both methods revealed areas of high use around the focal colony, but over the wider region, differences emerged that were likely attributable to the influences of neighboring colonies and the presence of non-breeding birds. The magnitude of differences was linked to the relative sizes of these populations, being larger in guillemots. Whilst boat surveys were necessarily restricted to the hours of daylight, GPS data were obtained equally during day and night. For guillemots, there was little effect of calculating separate night and day distributions from GPS records, but for razorbills the daytime distribution matched boat-based distributions better. When GPS-based distribution estimates were restricted to the exact times when boat surveys were carried out, similarity with boat survey distributions decreased, probably due to reduced sample sizes. Our results support the use of tracking data for defining seabird distributions around tracked birds' home colonies, but only when nearby colonies are neither large nor numerous. Distributions of animals around isolated colonies can be determined using GPS loggers but that of animals around aggregated colonies is best suited to at-sea surveys or multi-colony tracking.},

abstract = {Aims: ite occupancy probabilities of target species are commonly used in various ecological studies, e.g. to monitor current status and trends in biodiversity. Detection error introduces bias in the estimators of site occupancy. Existing methods for estimating occupancy probability in the presence of detection error use replicate surveys. These methods assume population closure, i.e. the site occupancy status remains constant across surveys, and independence between surveys. We present an approach for estimating site occupancy probability in the presence of detection error that requires only a single survey and does not require assumption of population closure or independence. In place of the closure assumption, this method requires covariates that affect detection and occupancy. Methods: Penalized maximum-likelihood method was used to estimate the parameters. Estimability of the parameters was checked using data cloning. Parametric boostrapping method was used for computing confidence intervals. Important Findings: The single-survey approach facilitates analysis of historical datasets where replicate surveys are unavailable, situations where replicate surveys are expensive to conduct and when the assumptions of closure or independence are not met. This method saves significant amounts of time, energy and money in ecological surveys without sacrificing statistical validity. Further, we show that occupancy and habitat suitability are not synonymous and suggest a method to estimate habitat suitability using single-survey data. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.

abstract = {Heterogeneous usage of space by individual animals or animal populations is partly due to their preference for particular resources that are, themselves, heterogeneously distributed. When all points in the environment are equally accessible, a direct relationship between usage and preference can be assumed. However, when accessibility is restricted, spatial variations in usage can no longer be attributed entirely to preference. In such cases, it is necessary to control for the effects of accessibility on observed usage before conclusions about preference can be drawn. In this paper, I develop a modelling framework that treats the use of space by animals as a joint function of preference and accessibility. I specify a null version of the framework that assumes no preference and propose that its output can be used to control for the effect of accessibility on the observed, spatial distribution of usage. I briefly discuss how the framework can subsequently be used to provide insights about the animals preference for different resources and types of movement, and to predict usage in areas where no usage data exist. I explore the properties of the methodology using data from a population of simulated animals and present the first results of its application to a sub-set of the British population of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus).},

We outline the general principles that have guided data integration methods and review recent developments in the field. We then outline key areas that allow for a more general framework for integrating data and provide suggestions for improving sampling design and validation for integrated models. Key to recent advances has been using point-process thinking to combine estimators developed for different data types. Extending this framework to new data types will further improve our inferences, as well as relaxing assumptions about how parameters are jointly estimated. These along with the better use of information regarding sampling effort and spatial autocorrelation will further improve our inferences. Recent developments form a strong foundation for implementation of data integration models. Wider adoption can improve our inferences about species distributions and the dynamic processes that lead to distributional shifts.},

However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of 'translators' between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientific knowledge and conservation outcomes.},

In accordance with European Union legislation, the UK proposes to extend Special Protection Areas (SPAs) into the offshore zone for seabirds. This study provides the basis of a foraging range extension to the main UK SPA colony of breeding little tern (Sternula albifrons). We applied several established analytical approaches to identify MPAs to multiple data sources including boat-based surveys and individual tracking, alongside a 'foraging radius' approach derived from published foraging range. We pooled data from multiple seasons to account for any inter-annual variation in foraging range and distribution. Minimum convex polygon (MCP), kernel density contours and a linked distance cluster method were performed on tracking data, whereas Generalised Additive Models and kernel density estimation were applied to boat-based survey data. The shape and size of the MPAs produced from analyses of the different datasets were broadly similar to each other, generating confidence in the outputs and suggesting that an integrated approach may have widespread applicability. In contrast, generic foraging radii did not produce representative areas, suggesting restricted use as a preliminary scoping tool. Tracking reflected habitat use of birds of known provenance and a simple approach using 100{\%} MCP provided a clearly defined boundary to feed into marine spatial planning that incorporated all important foraging habitats, embraced threats from anthropogenic development and could 'future-proof' changes in colony location. Where resources are limited, tracking over multiple seasons may be the most efficacious means of deriving seabird MPAs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.Context: The scale of environmental relationships is often inferred through the use of species distribution models. Yet such models are frequently developed at two distinct scales. Coarse-scale models typically use information-poor (e.g., presence-only) data to predict relative distributions across geographic ranges, whereas fine-scale models often use richer information (e.g., presence–absence data) to predict distributions at local to landscape scales. Objectives: We unite presence–absence and presence-only data to predict occurrence of species, what we refer to as integrated distribution models. We determine if integrated models improve predictions of species distributions and identification of characteristic spatial scales of environmental relationships relative to presence–absence modeling and ensemble modeling that averages predictions from separate presence-only and presence–absence models. Methods: We apply recent advances in integrated distribution models to predict Sherman's fox squirrel (Sciurus niger shermani) distribution in north-central Florida. Presence-only data were collected through a citizen-science program across its geographic range, while presence–absence data were collected using camera trapping surveys across 40 landscapes. Results: Integrated models estimated environmental relationships with greater precision and identified larger characteristic scales for environmental relationships than using presence–absence data alone. In addition, integrated models tended to have greater predictive performance, which was more robust to the amount of presence–absence and presence-only data used in modeling, than presence–absence and ensemble models. Conclusions: Integrated distribution models hold much potential for improving our understanding of environmental relationships, the scales at which environmental relationships operate, and providing more accurate predictions of species distributions. Many avenues exist for further advancement of these modeling approaches.},

Furthermore, recent statistical advances mean that such data can be used to test ecological hypotheses and estimate species' distributions. Black-browed Albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys are highly mobile marine predators with a circumpolar breeding and foraging distribution in the Southern Hemisphere. Although they remain relatively abundant, increased fisheries bycatch has led to their listing as endangered by conservation bodies. We satellite-tracked 163 breeding Black-browed Albatrosses and eight closely related Campbell Albatrosses T. impavida from nine colonies. We then quantified habitat usage, and modeled population-level spatial distribution at spatiotemporal scales {\textgreater}50 km and 1 month, as a function of habitat accessibility, habitat preference, and intraspecific competition, using mixed-effects generalized additive models (GAMM). During incubation, birds foraged over a wider area than in the post-brood chick-rearing period, when they are more time constrained. Throughout breeding, the order of habitat preference of Black-browed Albatrosses was for neritic (0-500 m), shelf-break and upper shelf-slope (500-1000 m), and then oceanic ({\textgreater}1000 m) waters. Black-browed Albatrosses also preferred areas with steeper ({\textgreater}3°) bathymetric relief and, in addition, during incubation, warmer sea surface temperatures (peak preference ∼16°C). Although this suggests specialization in neritic habitats, incubation-stage Blackbrowed Albatrosses from South Georgia also foraged extensively in oceanic waters, preferring areas with high eddy kinetic energy ({\textgreater}250 cm2/s2), especially the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, a region of intense mesoscale turbulence. During chick-rearing, this species had a more southerly distribution, and following the seasonal retreat of sea ice, birds from some populations utilized neritic polar waters. Campbell Albatrosses showed similar bathymetric preferences but also preferred positive sea level anomalies. Black-browed Albatross foraging areas were partially spatially segregated with respect to colony and region, with birds preferring locations distant from neighboring colonies, presumably in order to reduce competition between parapatric conspecifics. At the global scale, the greatest concentrations of breeding Black-browed Albatrosses are in southern South American neritic, shelf-break, and shelf-slope waters. These regions also hold large fisheries and should therefore be a priority for introduction of bycatch mitigation measures. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Studies aimed at estimating species site occupancy while accounting for imperfect detection are common in ecology and conservation. Often there is interest in assessing whether occupancy differs between two samples, for example, two points in time, areas or habitats. To ensure that meaningful results are obtained in such studies, attention has to be paid to their design, and power analysis is a useful means to accomplish this. 2.We provide tools for conducting power analysis in studies aimed at detecting occupancy differences under imperfect detection and explore associated design trade-offs. We derive a formula in closed form that conveniently allows determining the sample size required to detect a difference in occupancy with a given power. Because this formula is based on asymptotic approximations, we use simulations to assess its performance, at the same time comparing that of different significance tests. 3.We show that the closed-formula performs well in a wide range of scenarios, providing a useful lower sample size bound. For the simulated scenarios, a Wald test on the probability scale was the most powerful test among those evaluated. We found that choosing the number of repeat visits based on existing recommendations for single-season studies will often be a good approach in terms of minimizing the effort required to achieve a given power..We demonstrate that our results and discussion are applicable regardless of whether independence or Markovian dependence is assumed in the occupancy status of sites between seasons, and illustrate their utility when designing to detect a trend in multiple-season studies. Assessing differences in species occupancy is relevant in many ecological and conservation applications. For the outcome of these monitoring efforts to be meaningful and so to avoid wasting the often limited resources, survey design has to be carefully addressed to ensure that the relevant differences can be indeed detected and that this is achieved in the most efficient way. Here, we provide guidance and tools of immediate practical use for the design of such studies, including code to conduct power analysis. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Management and conservation of populations of animals requires information on where they are, why they are there, and where else they could be. These objectives are typically approached by collecting data on the animals' use of space, relating these positional data to prevailing environmental conditions and employing the resulting statistical models to predict usage at other geographical regions. Technical advances in wildlife telemetry have accomplished manifold increases in the amount and quality of available data, creating the need for a statistical framework that can use them to make population-level inferences for habitat preference and space-use. This has been slow-in-coming because wildlife telemetry data are spatio-temporally autocorrelated, often unbalanced, presence-only observations of behaviourally complex animals, responding to a multitude of cross-correlated environmental variables. We review the evolution of regression models for the analysis of space-use and habitat preference and outline the essential features of a framework that emerges naturally from these foundations. This allows us to derive a relationship between usage of points in geographical space and preference of habitats in environmental space. Within this framework, we discuss eight challenges, inherent in the spatial analysis of telemetry data and, for each, we propose solutions that can work in tandem. Specifically, we propose a logistic, mixed-effects approach that uses generalized additive transformations of the environmental covariates and is fitted to a response data-set comprising the telemetry and simulated observations, under a case-control design. We apply this framework to a non-trivial case-study using satellite-tagged grey seals Halichoerus grypus from the east coast of Scotland. We perform model selection by cross-validation and confront our final model's predictions with telemetry data from the same, as well as different, geographical regions. We conclude that, despite the complex behaviour of the study species, flexible empirical models can capture the environmental relationships that shape population distributions.},

Recent advancements in information technology and data acquisition have created both new research opportunities and new challenges for using big data in ornithology. We provide an overview of the past, present, and future of big data in ornithology, and explore the rewards and risks associated with their application. Structured data resources (e.g., North American Breeding Bird Survey) continue to play an important role in advancing our understanding of bird population ecology, and the recent advent of semistructured (e.g., eBird) and unstructured (e.g., weather surveillance radar) big data resources has promoted the development of new empirical perspectives that are generating novel insights. For example, big data have been used to study and model bird diversity and distributions across space and time, explore the patterns and determinants of broad-scale migration strategies, and examine the dynamics and mechanisms associated with geographic and phenological responses to global change. The application of big data also holds a number of challenges wherein high data volume and dimensionality can result in noise accumulation, spurious correlations, and incidental endogeneity. In total, big data resources continue to add empirical breadth and detail to ornithology, often at very broad spatial extents, but how the challenges underlying this approach can best be mitigated to maximize inferential quality and rigor needs to be carefully considered.},

abstract = {Colonial seabirds are relatively easy to observe, count, measure and manipulate, and consequently have long been used as models for testing ecological hypotheses. A combination of animal tracking and satellite imagery has the potential to greatly inform such efforts, by allowing seabird-environment interactions to be observed remotely. We review how this can be achieved by applying innovative statistical techniques to quantify habitat use and preferences. Seabird movements are now observable at scales of meters using GPS loggers, and up to several years using light-based geolocation, while satellite remote sensing systems, at resolutions of km, are capable of characterizing the millions of km(2) of habitat that are accessible to seabirds. Physical forcing and biological processes result in a hierarchical, patchy distribution of prey. Hence, analyses of seabird movements should be conducted at appropriate scales. Variation in habitat accessibility should also be considered: this declines with distance from the colony during the breeding season, when seabirds are central place foragers, and may be limited in the nonbreeding period by migration corridors that are defined by wind patterns. Intraspecific competition can further modify spatial usage, leading to spatial segregation of birds foraging from different colonies. We recommend that spatial usage be modeled as a function of habitat preference, accessibility and, potentially, competition. At the population level, this is currently best achieved using an empirical approach (e.g. using mixed-effects generalized additive models), At the individual level, more mechanistic models (e.g. state-space models) are more appropriate and have the advantage of modeling location errors explicitly.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Upwelling regions are highly productive habitats targeted by wide-ranging marine predators and industrial fisheries. In this study, we track the migratory movements of eight seabird species from across the Atlantic; quantify overlap with the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) and determine the habitat characteristics that drive this association. Our results indicate the CCLME is a biodiversity hotspot for migratory seabirds; all tracked species and more than 70{\%} of individuals used this upwelling region. Relative species richness peaked in areas where sea surface temperature averaged between 15 and 20°C, and correlated positively with chlorophyll a, revealing the optimum conditions driving bottom-up trophic effects for seabirds. Marine vertebrates are not confined by international boundaries, making conservation challenging. However, by linking diversity to ocean productivity, our research reveals the significance of the CCLME for seabird populations from across the Atlantic, making it a priority for conservation action.},

abstract = {Many statisticians have had the experience of fitting a linear model with uncorrelated errors, then adding a spatiallycorrelated error term (random effect) and finding that the estimates of the fixed-effect coefficients have changed substantially. We show that adding a spatially-correlated error term to a linear model is equivalent to adding a saturated collection of canonical regressors, the coefficients of which are shrunk toward zero, where the spatial map determines both the canonical regressors and the relative extent of the coefficients' shrinkage. Adding a spatially-correlated error term can also be seen as inflating the error variances associated with specific contrasts of the data, where the spatial map determines the contrasts and the extent of error-variance inflation. We show how to avoid this spatial confounding by restricting the spatial random effect to the orthogonal complement (residual space) of the fixed effects, which we call restricted spatial regression. We consider five proposed interpretations of spatial confounding and draw implications about what, if anything, one should do about it. In doing so, we debunk the common belief that adding a spatially-correlated random effect adjusts fixed-effect estimates for spatially-structured missing covariates.

abstract = {In the marine environment Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have been used in hundreds of papers for predicting the present and future geographic range and environmental niche of species. We have analyzed ways in which SDMs are being applied to marine species in order to recommend best practice in future studies. This systematic review was registered as a protocol on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/tngs6/. The literature reviewed (236 papers) was published between 1992 and July 2016. The number of papers significantly increased through time (R 2 = 0.92, p {\textless} 0.05). The studies were predominantly carried out in the Temperate Northern Atlantic (45{\%}) followed by studies of global scale (11{\%}) and studies in Temperate Australasia (10{\%}). The majority of studies reviewed focused on theoretical ecology (37{\%}) including investigations of biological invasions by non-native organisms, conservation planning (19{\%}), and climate change predictions (17{\%}). Most of the studies were published in ecological, multidisciplinary, or biodiversity conservation journals. Most of the studies (94{\%}) failed to report the amount of uncertainty derived from data deficiencies and model parameters. Best practice recommendations are proposed here to ensure that novice and advanced SDM users can (a) understand the main elements of SDMs, (b) reproduce standard methods and analysis, and (c) identify potential limitations with their data. We suggest that in the future, studies of marine SDMs should report on key features of the approaches employed, data deficiencies, the selection of the best explanatory model, and the approach taken to validate the SDM results. In addition, based on the literature reviewed, we suggest that future marine SDMs should account for uncertainty levels as part of the modeling process.},

abstract = {Large carnivores are declining globally and require baseline population estimates for management, however large-scale population estimation is problematic for species without unique natural marks. We used camera trap records of dhole Cuon alpinus, a group-living species, from three national parks in Thailand as a case study in which we develop integrated likelihood models to estimate abundance incorporating two different data sets, count data and detection/non-detection data. We further investigated relative biases of the models using different proportions of data with lower versus higher quality and assessed parameter identifiability. The simulations indicated that the relative bias on average across 24 tested scenarios was 2{\%} with a 95{\%} chance that the simulated data sets obtained the true animal abundances. We found that bias was high ({\textgreater}10{\%}) when sampling 60 sites with only 5 sampling occasions. We tested four additional scenarios with varying proportions of count data. Our model tolerated the use of relatively low proportions of the higher quality count data, but below 10{\%} the results began to show bias ({\textgreater}6{\%}). Data cloning indicated that the parameters were identifiable with all posterior variances shrinking to near zero. Our model demonstrates the benefits of combining data from multiple studies even with different data types. Furthermore, the approach is not limited to camera trap data. Detection/non-detection data from track surveys or counts from transects could also be combined. Particularly, our model is potentially useful for assessing populations of rare species where large amounts of by-catch datasets are available.},

@article{Guisan2000,
abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.

@article{Clark2019a,
abstract = {Many animal populations are thought to be in flux due to anthropogenic impacts. However, censusing organisms to understand such changes is often impractical. For example, while it is thought that over half of pelagic seabird populations are declining, most breed in burrows or on cliffs, in large, remote colonies, making them difficult to count. Burrow-nesting sooty shearwaters (Ardenna grisea) are abundant but declining in their core (South Pacific) breeding range, potentially due to introduced rodents and habitat loss. In contrast, Kidney Island, their largest colony in the Falkland Islands (Southwest Atlantic), purportedly grew by several orders of magnitude since the mid-1900s. This island is rodent-free, and native tussac grass (Poa flabellata) has increased following cessation of historical exploitation. To estimate the sooty shearwater population in the Falkland Islands, and its relationship with breeding habitat availability, we sampled burrow density and occupancy on Kidney Island and modeled these as functions of habitat. Both indices responded positively to a proxy for historical increases in tussac cover. We estimate that breeding sooty shearwaters occupy ∼140,000 (95{\%} CI: 90,000–210,000) burrows on Kidney Island. Moreover, using additional survey data and Generalized Functional Response models to account for intra-island variation in habitat availability, we estimate that 25,000 (95{\%} CI: 20,100 - 30,500) burrows could be occupied on nearby islands from which non-native rodents have been recently eradicated. Our study shows that habitat selection functions, generalized where necessary, not only improve population estimates but provide biological insights needed to reverse declines in seabirds and other species.},

abstract = {Aim: Our aim involved developing a method to analyse spatiotemporal distributions of Arctic marine mammals (AMMs) using heterogeneous open source data, such as scientific papers and open repositories. Another aim was to quantitatively estimate the effects of environmental covariates on AMMs' distributions and to analyse whether their distributions have shifted along with environmental changes. Location: Arctic shelf area. The Kara Sea. Methods: Our literature search focused on survey data regarding polar bears (Ursus maritimus), Atlantic walruses (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) and ringed seals (Phoca hispida). We mapped the data on a grid and built a hierarchical Poisson point process model to analyse species' densities. The heterogeneous data lacked information on survey intensity and we could model only the relative density of each species. We explained relative densities with environmental covariates and random effects reflecting excess spatiotemporal variation and the unknown, varying sampling effort. The relative density of polar bears was explained also by the relative density of seals. Results: The most important covariates explaining AMMs' relative densities were ice concentration and distance to the coast, and regarding polar bears, also the relative density of seals. The results suggest that due to the decrease in the average ice concentration, the relative densities of polar bears and walruses slightly decreased or stayed constant during the 17-year-long study period, whereas seals shifted their distribution from the Eastern to the Western Kara Sea. Main conclusions: Point process modelling is a robust methodology to estimate distributions from heterogeneous observations, providing spatially explicit information about ecosystems and thus serves advances for conservation efforts in the Arctic. In a simple trophic system, a distribution model of a top predator benefits from utilizing prey species' distributions compared to a solely environmental model. The decreasing ice cover seems to have led to changes in AMMs' distributions in the marginal Arctic region.},

Using three Iberian Argiope spider species as models, this study aimed to compare the quality of three data sources – existing scientific literature, a biodiversity-focused photo-sharing citizen science project, and a photo-sharing social network – and the results derived from niche and distribution analyses. Data sources were compared in terms of sample size, spatial clustering, and coverage, degree of climatic niche completeness, and in their consistency in the characterisation of response curves. Possible biases towards big cities and protected natural areas were identified, and species distribution models were parameterised and compared. Photo records provided the largest number of occurrences, whereas data from scientific literature showed the worst spatial coverage. Records from the citizen science project yielded the highest degree of niche completeness. All data sources showed some bias towards big cities and protected areas. Data from existing scientific literature yielded the worst range representations and, accordingly, the most different distribution models, whereas the models based on two photo-vouchered sources were very similar. Range and niche analyses using records from different sources may yield disparate results. Occurrence data from existing scientific literature may not be enough to develop robust niche analyses nor to characterise recent range changes of poorly studied taxa. Photo-sharing platforms provide updated chorological information and have the potential to increase sample sizes dramatically, which is an important data property in distribution and niche modelling.},

abstract = {Whether considering the cumulative impact of chronic, small-size oil discharges or accidents associated with marine traffic and offshore oil and gas development, seabirds face a variety of threats in the marine environment. Assessing the vulnerabilities of seabirds to maritime hazards requires an understanding of their species distribution, and a means for combining this information across groups. Using at-sea survey data gathered as part of a regional monitoring program, an efficient framework for integrating multi-species data was developed. Survey data was incorporated within a distance sampling framework to generate bias-corrected seabird densities for an area of over 730,000km2 size, which were used to construct multiple species distribution models (SDMs). The structural difficulties associated with sampling sparsely distributed individuals that also occur in large, localized concentrations led to the use of three modelling techniques potentially well suited for this type of data: negative binomial, "hurdle", and random forest methods. Predicted abundances were combined to produce an ensemble forecast, which met or exceeded the accuracy of predictions from the individual models. Multi-species potential sensitivity maps were developed to identify core areas, confirming the general importance of physiographic features such as the shelf break and bathymetry. Distribution was also seasonally influenced, with spring and winter standing out as periods of peak importance. When combined with an oil pollution layer derived from aerial surveillance, vulnerability was highest in the vicinity of major ports (e.g., Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia). However, the vulnerability map also indicated lower but widespread levels of oiling risk throughout the shelf, presumably associated with persistently high levels of shipping traffic and ongoing petroleum extraction and exploration. Outside of this region, migratory connectivity is expected to expose seabirds to a wider network of hazards and further underscores the need for the coordinated and routine collection of marine hazard data alongside at-sea distributional data. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. In the UK, resolving conflicts between the conservation of grey seals, the management of fish stocks and marine exploitation requires knowledge of the seals' use of space. We present a map of grey seal usage around the British Isles based on satellite telemetry data from adult animals and haul-out survey data. 2. Our approach combined modelling and interpolation. To model the seals' association with particular coastal sites (the haul-outs), we divided the population into subpopulations associated with 24 haul-out groups. Haul-out-specific maps of accessibility were used to supervise usage estimation from satellite telemetry. The mean and variance of seal numbers at each haul-out group were obtained from haul-out counts. The aggregate map of usage for the entire population was produced by adding together the haul-out-specific usage maps, weighted by mean number of animals using that haul-out. 3. Seal usage was primarily concentrated (i) off the northern coasts of the British Isles, (ii) closer to the coast than might be expected purely on the basis of accessibility from the haul-outs and (iii) in a limited number of marine hot-spots. 4. Although our results currently represent the best estimate of how grey seals use the marine environment around Britain, they are neither definitive nor equally precise for all haul-outs.

This work provides environmental managers with current estimates of grey seal usage and describes a methodology for maximizing data efficiency. Our results could guide government departments in licensing marine exploitation by the oil industry, in estimating grey seal predation pressure on vulnerable or economically important prey and in delineating marine special areas of conservation (SAC). Our finding that grey seal usage is characterized by a limited number of hot-spots means that the species is particularly suited to localized conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Knowledge about the spatial distribution of seabirds at sea is important for conservation. During marine conservation planning, logistical constraints preclude seabird surveys covering the complete area of interest and spatial distribution of seabirds is frequently inferred from predictive statistical models. Increasingly complex models are available to relate the distribution and abundance of pelagic seabirds to environmental variables, but a comparison of their usefulness for delineating protected areas for seabirds is lacking. Here we compare the performance of five modelling techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, Random Forest, boosted regression trees, and maximum entropy) to predict the distribution of Balearic Shearwaters (. Puffinus mauretanicus) along the coast of the western Iberian Peninsula. We used ship transect data from 2004 to 2009 and 13 environmental variables to predict occurrence and density, and evaluated predictive performance of all models using spatially segregated test data. Predicted distribution varied among the different models, although predictive performance varied little. An ensemble prediction that combined results from all five techniques was robust and confirmed the existence of marine important bird areas for Balearic Shearwaters in Portugal and Spain. Our predictions suggested additional areas that would be of high priority for conservation and could be proposed as protected areas. Abundance data were extremely difficult to predict, and none of five modelling techniques provided a reliable prediction of spatial patterns. We advocate the use of ensemble modelling that combines the output of several methods to predict the spatial distribution of seabirds, and use these predictions to target separate surveys assessing the abundance of seabirds in areas of regular use. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Understanding and accurately modeling species distributions lies at the heart of many problems in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Multiple sources of data are increasingly available for modeling species distributions, such as data from citizen science programs, atlases, museums, and planned surveys. Yet reliably combining data sources can be challenging because data sources can vary considerably in their design, gradients covered, and potential sampling biases. We review, synthesize and illustrate recent developments in combining multiple sources of data for species distribution modeling. We identify five ways in which multiple sources of data are typically combined for modeling species distributions. These approaches vary in their ability to accommodate sampling design, bias, and uncertainty when quantifying environmental relationships in species distribution models. Many of the challenges for combining data are solved through the prudent use of integrated species distribution models: models that simultaneously combine different data sources on species locations to quantify environmental relationships for explaining species distribution. We illustrate these approaches using planned survey data on 24 species of birds coupled with opportunistically collected eBird data in the southeastern United States. This example illustrates some of the benefits of data integration, such as increased precision in environmental relationships, greater predictive accuracy, and accounting for sample bias. Yet it also illustrates challenges of combining data sources with vastly different sampling methodologies and amounts of data. We provide one solution to this challenge through the use of weighted joint likelihoods. Weighted joint likelihoods provide a means to emphasize data sources based on different criteria (e.g., sample size) and we find that weighting improves predictions for all species considered. We conclude by providing practical guidance on combining multiple sources of data for modeling species distributions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Issues of residual spatial autocorrelation (RSA) and spatial scale are critical to the study of species–environment relationships, because RSA invalidates many statistical procedures, while the scale of analysis affects the quantification of these relationships. Although these issues independently are widely covered in the literature, only sparse attention is given to their integration. This paper focuses on the interplay between RSA and the spatial scaling of species–environment relationships. Using a hypothetical species in an artificial landscape, we show that a mismatch between the scale of analysis and the scale of a species' response to its environment leads to a decrease in the portion of variation explained by environmental predictors. Moreover, it results in RSA and biased regression coefficients. This bias stems from error-predictor dependencies due to the scale mismatch, the magnitude of which depends on the interaction between the scale of landscape heterogeneity and the scale of a species' response to this heterogeneity. We show that explicitly considering scale effects on RSA can reveal the characteristic scale of a species' response to its environment. This is important, because the estimation of species–environment relationships using spatial regression methods proves to be erroneous in case of a scale mismatch, leading to spurious conclusions when scaling issues are not explicitly considered. The findings presented here highlight the importance of examining the appropriateness of the spatial scales used in analyses, since scale mismatches affect the rigor of statistical analyses and thereby the ability to understand the processes underlying spatial patterning in ecological phenomena.

abstract = {Ecological theories often encompass multiple levels of biological organization, such as genes, individuals, populations, and communities. Despite substantial progress toward ecological theory spanning multiple levels, ecological data rarely are connected in this way. This is unfortunate because different types of ecological data often emerge from the same underlying processes and, therefore, are naturally connected among levels. Here, we describe an approach to integrate data collected at multiple levels (e.g., individuals, populations) in a single statistical analysis. The resulting integrated models make full use of existing data and might strengthen links between statistical ecology and ecological models and theories that span multiple levels of organization. Integrated models are increasingly feasible due to recent advances in computational statistics, which allow fast calculations of multiple likelihoods that depend on complex mechanistic models. We discuss recently developed integrated models and outline a simple application using data on freshwater fishes in south-eastern Australia. Available data on freshwater fishes include population survey data, mark-recapture data, and individual growth trajectories. We use these data to estimate age-specific survival and reproduction from size-structured data, accounting for imperfect detection of individuals. Given that such parameter estimates would be infeasible without an integrated model, we argue that integrated models will strengthen ecological theory by connecting theoretical and mathematical models directly to empirical data. Although integrated models remain conceptually and computationally challenging, integrating ecological data among levels is likely to be an important step toward unifying ecology among levels.},

abstract = {Field monitoring can vary from simple volunteer opportunistic observations to professional standardised monitoring surveys, leading to a trade-off between data quality and data collection costs. Such variability in data quality may result in biased predictions obtained from species distribution models (SDMs). We aimed to identify the limitations of different monitoring data sources for developing species distribution maps and to evaluate their potential for spatial data integration in a conservation context. Using Maxent, SDMs were generated from three different bird data sources in Catalonia, which differ in the degree of standardisation and available sample size. In addition, an alternative approach for modelling species distributions was applied, which combined the three data sources at a large spatial scale, but then downscaling to the required resolution. Finally, SDM predictions were used to identify species richness and high quality areas (hotspots) from different treatments. Models were evaluated by using high quality Atlas information. We show that both sample size and survey methodology used to collect the data are important in delivering robust information on species distributions. Models based on standardized monitoring provided higher accuracy with a lower sample size, especially when modelling common species. Accuracy of models from opportunistic observations substantially increased when modelling uncommon species, giving similar accuracy to a more standardized survey. Although downscaling data through a SDM approach appears to be a useful tool in cases of data shortage or low data quality and heterogeneity, it will tend to overestimate species distributions. In order to identify distributions of species, data with different quality may be appropriate. However, to identify biodiversity hotspots high quality information is needed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {There is a growing need to identify Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) for marine species. For seabirds, MPAs include those near breeding colonies, offshore foraging areas, inshore habitats for wintering species, and migratory bottlenecks. However, frequently there is a lack of readily available current and comprehensive data on foraging areas used by species from particular colonies. Therefore, representative breeding season foraging ranges for each species may be useful alongside other datasets for scoping candidate MPAs. We reviewed studies that estimated foraging range for 25 species of UK breeding seabirds. For representative foraging ranges, we prioritised studies, giving highest value to those based on direct tracking of birds (21{\%}); then those involving indirect estimates using flight speeds and time activity (12{\%}) followed by, boat, aerial, and land-based 'survey' observations (46{\%}); and finally we gave lowest value to speculative estimates (21{\%}). Highest confidence was placed in the foraging ranges of northern gannet (Morus bassanus), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), and common guillemot (Uria aalge), and lowest for common gull (Larus canus), common eider (Somateria mollissima), Leach's (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) and European storm petrels (Hydrobates pelagicus). Both annual and colony-specific variation was evident for some species. Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), northern gannet, and northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), had the largest foraging ranges (maximum ranges {\textgreater}330, 590 and 580. km, respectively), whereas red-throated diver (Gavia stellata) and little tern (Sternula albifrons) had the smallest (maximum ranges 9 and 11. km, respectively). Representative foraging ranges may be useful to suggest likely colony-specific foraging areas, prior to habitat-association modelling for defining candidate MPAs. The approach here has international applicability, and would help progress towards more comprehensive protection of seabird populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Understanding how seabirds use the marine environment is key for marine spatial planning, and maps of their marine distributions derived from transect-based surveys and from tracking of individual bird's movements are increasingly available for the same geographic areas. Although the value of integrating these different datasets is well recognised, few studies have undertaken quantitative comparisons of the resulting distributions. Here we take advantage of four existing distribution maps and conduct a quantitative comparison for four seabird species (black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla; European shag Phalacrocorax aris-totelis; common guillemot Uria aalge; and razorbill Alca torda). We quantify the amount of overlap and agreement in the location of high use areas identified from either tracking or transect samples and use Bhattacharyya's Affinity to quantify levels of similarity in the general distribution patterns. Despite multiple differences in the properties of the datasets, there was a far greater degree of overlap than would be expected by chance, except when adopting the most constrained definition of high use. Distance to the nearest conspecific colony appeared to be an important driver of the degree of similarity. Agreed areas of highest use tended to occur close to colonies and, with increasing distance from colonies, similarity between datasets declined and/or there was similarity in respect of their being relatively low usage. Interpreting reasons for agreement between data sources in some areas and not others was limited by an inability to control for the multiple potential sources of differences from both the sampling and modelling processes of the underlying datasets. Nevertheless, our quantitative comparative approach provides a valuable tool to quantify the degree to which an area's importance is corroborated across multiple datasets, and therefore confidence that an important area has been correctly identified. This can help prioritise where the implementation of conservation measures should be targeted and identify where greatest scrutiny is required of the potential adverse environmental effects of any planned anthropogenic activities.},

We show that false-negative errors (failure to record a species when in fact it is present) can have a significant impact on statistical estimation of habitat models using simulated data. Then we introduce an extension of logistic modeling, the zero-inflated binomial (ZIB) model that permits the estimation of the rate of false-negative errors and the correction of estimates of the probability of occurrence for false-negative errors by using repeated visits to the same site. Our simulations show that even relatively low rates of false negatives bias statistical estimates of habitat effects. The method with three repeated visits eliminates the bias, but estimates are relatively imprecise. Six repeated visits improve precision of estimates to levels comparable to that achieved with conventional statistics in the absence of false-negative errors. In general, when error rates are ≤50{\%} greater efficiency is gained by adding more sites, whereas when error rates are {\textgreater}50{\%} it is better to increase the number of repeated visits. We highlight the flexibility of the method with three case studies, clearly demonstrating the effect of false-negative errors for a range of commonly used survey methods.},

abstract = {In tropical waters resources are usually scarce and patchy, and predatory species generally show specific adaptations for foraging. Tropical seabirds often forage in association with sub-surface predators that create feeding opportunities by bringing prey close to the surface, and the birds often aggregate in large multispecific flocks. Here we hypothesize that frigatebirds, a tropical seabird adapted to foraging with low energetic costs, could be a good predictor of the distribution of their associated predatory species, including other seabirds (e.g. boobies, terns) and subsurface predators (e.g., dolphins, tunas). To test this hypothesis, we compared distribution patterns of marine predators in the Mozambique Channel based on a long-term dataset of both vessel- and aerial surveys, as well as tracking data of frigatebirds. By developing species distribution models (SDMs), we identified key marine areas for tropical predators in relation to contemporaneous oceanographic features to investigate multi-species spatial overlap areas and identify predator hotspots in the Mozambique Channel. SDMs reasonably matched observed patterns and both static (e.g. bathymetry) and dynamic (e.g. Chlorophyll a concentration and sea surface temperature) factors were important explaining predator distribution patterns. We found that the distribution of frigatebirds included the distributions of the associated species. The central part of the channel appeared to be the best habitat for the four groups of species considered in this study (frigatebirds, brown terns, boobies and sub-surface predators).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Methods in Ecology and Evolution {\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society Biological monitoring programmes are increasingly relying upon large volumes of citizen-science data to improve the scope and spatial coverage of information, challenging the scientific community to develop design and model-based approaches to improve inference. Recent statistical models in ecology have been developed to accommodate false-negative errors, although current work points to false-positive errors as equally important sources of bias. This is of particular concern for the success of any monitoring programme given that rates as small as 3{\%} could lead to the overestimation of the occurrence of rare events by as much as 50{\%}, and even small false-positive rates can severely bias estimates of occurrence dynamics. We present an integrated, computationally efficient Bayesian hierarchical model to correct for false-positive and false-negative errors in detection/non-detection data. Our model combines independent, auxiliary data sources with field observations to improve the estimation of false-positive rates, when a subset of field observations cannot be validated a posteriori or assumed as perfect. We evaluated the performance of the model across a range of occurrence rates, false-positive and false-negative errors, and quantity of auxiliary data. The model performed well under all simulated scenarios, and we were able to identify critical auxiliary data characteristics which resulted in improved inference. We applied our false-positive model to a large-scale, citizen-science monitoring programme for anurans in the north-eastern United States, using auxiliary data from an experiment designed to estimate false-positive error rates. Not correcting for false-positive rates resulted in biased estimates of occupancy in 4 of the 10 anuran species we analysed, leading to an overestimation of the average number of occupied survey routes by as much as 70{\%}. The framework we present for data collection and analysis is able to efficiently provide reliable inference for occurrence patterns using data from a citizen-science monitoring programme. However, our approach is applicable to data generated by any type of research and monitoring programme, independent of skill level or scale, when effort is placed on obtaining auxiliary information on false-positive rates.},

Citizen science offers a way to collect a massive amount of data at negligible cost and has been shown to be a useful supplement to traditional analyses.

In this paper, we investigate the use of auxiliary (e.g. citizen science) data as a guide to designing more efficient ecological surveys. Our aim is to explore the use of opportunistic data to inform spatial survey design through a novel objective function that minimizes misclassificaton rate (i.e. false positives and false negatives) of the estimated occupancy maps. We use an initial occupancy estimate from auxiliary data as the prior in a Bayesian spatial occupancy model, and an efficient posterior approximation that accounts for spatial dependence, covariate effects, and imperfect detection in an exchange algorithm to search for the optimal set of sampling locations to minimize misclassification rate. We examine the optimal design as a function of the detection rate and quality of the citizen-science data, and compare this optimal design with several common ad hoc designs via an extensive simulation study. We then apply our method to eBird data for the brown-headed nuthatch in the Southeast US. We argue that planning a survey with the use of auxiliary data improves estimation accuracy and may significantly reduce the costs of sampling.},

abstract = {Designating Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is seen to be fundamental to future seabird conservation. In accordance with European Union legislation, the UK proposes to extend Special Protection Areas (SPAs) into the offshore zone for seabirds. This study provides the basis of a foraging range extension to the main UK SPA colony of breeding little tern (Sternula albifrons). We applied several established analytical approaches to identify MPAs to multiple data sources including boat-based surveys and individual tracking, alongside a 'foraging radius' approach derived from published foraging range. We pooled data from multiple seasons to account for any inter-annual variation in foraging range and distribution. Minimum convex polygon (MCP), kernel density contours and a linked distance cluster method were performed on tracking data, whereas Generalised Additive Models and kernel density estimation were applied to boat-based survey data. The shape and size of the MPAs produced from analyses of the different datasets were broadly similar to each other, generating confidence in the outputs and suggesting that an integrated approach may have widespread applicability. In contrast, generic foraging radii did not produce representative areas, suggesting restricted use as a preliminary scoping tool. Tracking reflected habitat use of birds of known provenance and a simple approach using 100{\%} MCP provided a clearly defined boundary to feed into marine spatial planning that incorporated all important foraging habitats, embraced threats from anthropogenic development and could 'future-proof' changes in colony location. Where resources are limited, tracking over multiple seasons may be the most efficacious means of deriving seabird MPAs.},

abstract = {New methods for species distribution models (SDMs) utilise presence–absence (PA) data to correct the sampling bias of presence-only (PO) data in a spatial point process setting. These have been shown to improve species estimates when both datasets are large and dense. However, is a PA dataset that is smaller and patchier than hitherto examined able to do the same? Furthermore, when both datasets are relatively small, is there enough information contained within them to produce a useful estimate of species' distributions? These attributes are common in many applications. A stochastic simulation was conducted to assess the ability of a pooled data SDM to estimate the distribution of species from increasingly sparser and patchier datasets. The simulated datasets were varied by changing the number of presence–absence sample locations, the degree of patchiness of these locations, the number of PO observations, and the level of sampling bias within the PO observations. The performance of the pooled data SDM was compared to a PA SDM and a PO SDM to assess the strengths and limitations of each SDM. The pooled data SDM successfully removed the sampling bias from the PO observations even when the presence–absence data were sparse and patchy, and the PO observations formed the majority of the data. The pooled data SDM was, in general, more accurate and more precise than either the PA SDM or the PO SDM. All SDMs were more precise for the species responses than they were for the covariate coefficients. The emerging SDM methodology that pools PO and PA data will facilitate more certainty around species' distribution estimates, which in turn will allow more relevant and concise management and policy decisions to be enacted. This work shows that it is possible to achieve this result even in relatively data-poor regions.},

abstract = {Advances in species distribution modeling continue to be driven by a need to predict species responses to environmental change coupled with increasing data availability. Recent work has focused on development of methods that integrate multiple streams of data to model species distributions. Combining sources of information increases spatial coverage and can improve accuracy in estimates of species distributions. However, when fusing multiple streams of data, the temporal and spatial resolutions of data sources may be mismatched. This occurs when data sources have fluctuating geographic coverage, varying spatial scales and resolutions, and differing sources of bias and sparsity. It is well documented in the spatial statistics literature that ignoring the misalignment of different data sources will result in bias in both the point estimates and uncertainty. This will ultimately lead to inaccurate predictions of species distributions. Here, we examine the issue of misaligned data as it relates specifically to integrated species distribution models. We then provide a general solution that builds off work in the statistical literature for the change-of-support problem. Specifically, we leverage spatial correlation and repeat observations at multiple scales to make statistically valid predictions at the ecologically relevant scale of inference. An added feature of the approach is that addressing differences in spatial resolution between data sets can allow for the evaluation and calibration of lesser-quality sources in many instances. Using both simulations and data examples, we highlight the utility of this modeling approach and the consequences of not reconciling misaligned spatial data. We conclude with a brief discussion of the upcoming challenges and obstacles for species distribution modeling via data fusion.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America. The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the use of species distribution models (SDMs) to characterize patterns of species' occurrence and abundance. Efforts to parameterize SDMs often create a tension between the quality and quantity of data available to fit models. Estimation methods that integrate both standardized and non-standardized data types offer a potential solution to the tradeoff between data quality and quantity. Recently several authors have developed approaches for jointly modeling two sources of data (one of high quality and one of lesser quality). We extend their work by allowing for explicit spatial autocorrelation in occurrence and detection error using a Multivariate Conditional Autoregressive (MVCAR) model and develop three models that share information in a less direct manner resulting in more robust performance when the auxiliary data is of lesser quality. We describe these three new approaches ("Shared," "Correlation," "Covariates") for combining data sources and show their use in a case study of the Brown-headed Nuthatch in the Southeastern U.S. and through simulations. All three of the approaches which used the second data source improved out-of- sample predictions relative to a single data source ("Single"). When information in the second data source is of high quality, the Shared model performs the best, but the Correlation and Covariates model also perform well. When the information quality in the second data source is of lesser quality, the Correlation and Covariates model performed better suggesting they are robust alternatives when little is known about auxiliary data collected opportunistically or through citizen scientists. Methods that allow for both data types to be used will maximize the useful information available for estimating species distributions.},

abstract = {. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) provide an important tool for conservation of marine ecosystems. To be most effective, these areas should be strategically located in a manner that supports ecosystem function. To inform marine spatial planning and support strategic establishment of MPAs within the California Current System, we identified areas predicted to support multispecies aggregations of seabirds ("hotspots"). We developed habitat-association models for 16 species using information from at-sea observations collected over an 11 -year period (1997-2008), bathym{\'{e}}trie data, and remotely sensed oceanographic data for an area from north of Vancouver Island, Canada, to the USA/Mexico border and seaward 600 km from the coast. This approach enabled us to predict distribution and abundance of seabirds even in areas of few or no surveys. We developed single-species predictive models using a machine-learning algorithm: bagged decision trees. Single-species predictions were then combined to identify potential hotspots of seabird aggregation, using three criteria: (1) overall abundance among species, (2) importance of specific areas ("core areas") to individual species, and (3) predicted persistence of hotspots across years. Model predictions were applied to the entire California Current for four seasons (represented by February, May, July, and October) in each of 1 1 years. Overall, bathym{\'{e}}trie variables were often important predictive variables, whereas oceanographic variables derived from remotely sensed data were generally less important. Predicted hotspots often aligned with currently protected areas (e.g., National Marine Sanctuaries), but we also identified potential hotspots in Northern California/Southern Oregon (from Cape Mendocino to Heceta Bank), Southern California (adjacent to the Channel Islands), and adjacent to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, that are not currently included in protected areas. Prioritization and identification of multispecies hotspots will depend on which group of species is of highest management priority. Modeling hotspots at a broad spatial scale can contribute to MPA site selection, particularly if complemented by fine-scale information for fo},

abstract = {1.Species monitoring is an essential component of assessing conservation status, predicting effects of habitat change and establishing management and conservation priorities. The pervasive access to the Internet has led to the development of several extensive monitoring projects that engage massive networks of volunteers who provide observations following relatively unstructured protocols. However, the value of these data is largely unknown. 2.We develop a novel cross-data validation method for measuring the value of survey data from one source (e.g. an Internet checklist program) relative to a second, benchmark data source. The method fits a model to the data of interest and validates the model using benchmark data, allowing us to isolate the training data's information content from its biases. We also define a data efficiency ratio to quantify the relative efficiency of the data sources. 3.We apply our cross-data validation method to quantify the value of data collected in eBird – a western hemisphere, year-round citizen science bird checklist project – relative to data from the highly standardized North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). The results show that eBird data contain information similar in quality to that in BBS data, while the information per BBS datum is higher. 4.We suggest that these methods have more general use in evaluating the suitability of sources of data for addressing specific questions for taxa of interest.},

abstract = {Efforts to draw inferences about species occurrence frequently account for false negatives, the common situation when individuals of a species are not detected even when a site is occupied. However, recent studies suggest the need to also deal with false positives, which occur when species are misidentified so that a species is recorded as detected when a site is unoccupied. Bias in estimators of occupancy, colonization, and extinction can be severe when false positives occur. Accordingly, we propose models that simultaneously account for both types of error. Our approach can be used to improve estimates of occupancy for study designs where a subset of detections is of a type or method for which false positives can be assumed to not occur.We illustrate properties of the estimators with simulations and data for three species of frogs. We show that models that account for possible misidentification have greater support (lower AIC for two species) and can yield substantially different occupancy estimates than those that do not. When the potential for misidentification exists, researchers should consider analytical techniques that can account for this source of error, such as those presented here. Key},
